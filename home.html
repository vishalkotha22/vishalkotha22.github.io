            Hi! My name is Vishal Kotha, and I'm currently a rising sophomore at TJ, a school in Alexandria, Virginia. <br>
            I've been passionate about coding since fourth grade. I've been working on some cool projects, and this is <br>
            where I'll be creating a portfolio of all the projects I've done. If you have any question or ideas of projects <br>
            please don't hesitate to contact me, my info is on the contact page. I have ideas for some cool things <br>
            in mind, so stay tuned.
